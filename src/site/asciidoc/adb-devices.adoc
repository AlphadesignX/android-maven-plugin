= Device Interaction 

The Android Maven Plugin supports interaction with all devices attached via adb. 

All goals interacting with devices, use the `device` parameter. By default, all devices are targeted. This includes
emulators as well as physical devices.

This means that e.g. deploying a build apk with `mvn package android:deploy` will deploy the apk to all attached devices.

Goals using the device interaction include 

* devices - list attached devices
* deploy - deploy apk of current project(s) to devices
* undeploy - undeploy apk of current project(s) from devices to 
* redeploy - undeploy and then deploy apk of current project(s)  
* deploy-apk - deploy specified apk 
* undeploy-apk - undeploy specified apk
* redeploy-apk - undeploy and deploy apk
* run - start the apk on the attached devices
* integration-test - run integration tests on all devices
* pull - copy a specified file from attached devices
* push  - copy a specified file to attached devices
