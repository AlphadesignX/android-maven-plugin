= Device Interaction 

The Android Maven Plugin supports interaction with all devices attached via adb. 

All goals interacting with devices, use the `device` parameter. By default, all devices are targetted.

This means that e.g. deploying a build apk with `mvn package android:deploy` will deploy the apk to all attached devices.

Goals using the device interaction include 

* deviceslist attached devices
* deploy
* undeploy
* redeploy
* deploy-apk
* undeploy-apk
* redeploy-apk
* run
* integration-test
* pull
* push
